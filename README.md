## Automatic Updates:

</p>

### Why Automatic Updates:
- Enabling Automatic updates help keep a server upto date with the latest patches and software updates. Which will prevent outdated vulnerable applications/software on the server from being expolited by malicious actors.

- A way to enable Automatic Updates is to make uses of "Cronjobs" which are scheduled automatic jobs done by the server itself without user intervention. Jobs may include backups, creating reports, cleanup tasks, <b>automatic updates</b>, and more. And for my server I created a cronjob that does the following:

### This cronjob will update the server every Friday at 12 PM:
``` 0 0 * * FRI apt-get update && apt-get upgrade ```


## Users:

Logging in as root is bad practice it leaves the server open to accidental deletions and other mishapes caused by common user errors. So it is absolutely vital to create a User Account with limited privledges. And For my server I did the following:

## Creating User

## Adding user to sudoer group

These images show the successful creation of a user with now limited privileges

## Firewalls

This project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors) specification and is brought to you by these [awesome contributors](./CONTRIBUTORS.md).

## Disable Vulnerable services
- Follow the [React Native Guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for getting started building a project with native code. **A Mac is required if you wish to develop for iOS.**
- Clone or download the repo
- `yarn` to install dependencies
- `yarn run link` to link react-native dependencies
- `yarn start:ios` to start the packager and run the app in the iOS simulator (`yarn start:ios:logger` will boot the application with [redux-logger](<https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger>))
- `yarn start:android` to start the packager and run the app in the the Android device/emulator (`yarn start:android:logger` will boot the application with [redux-logger](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger))

Please take a look at the [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for a detailed process on how to build your application as well as troubleshooting information.

**Development Keys**: The `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` in `api/index.js` are for development purposes and do not represent the actual application keys. Feel free to use them or use a new set of keys by creating an [OAuth application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) of your own. Set the "Authorization callback URL" to `gitpoint://welcome`.
